# MalCal
This is a simple chrome extension I made for myanimelist.net that inserts a weekly calendar of shows that a user has listed as Currently Watching.

### MyAnimeList list view with MalCal:

### MyAnimeList with no extension:

### Other
This injects directly to the dom based on the specific locations of elements and would break if the html were changed on MyAnimeList. That said it has worked for half a year so far so as of this commit (October 9, 2018) it still works.
